	I'm Himel Uddin and I went to Brooklyn Technical High School in NYC. I was
born in the Bronx and my family is originally from Bangladesh. I lived in Madrid for about 
eight years from the age of three to eleven then spent the rest of my years in the
city. I love music and recently started playing the guitar so that should be fun. I
also enjoy cooking and about three days ago I was able to buy a bunch of produce so I'm
looking foward to make some food.
